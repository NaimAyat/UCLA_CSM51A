## Binary Representations of Discrete Information
* How would you select a representation?
  * Choose based on implementation
  * How many bits are needed to represent days of the year?
    * 9 bits, there are 365 days in year and 2<sup>9</sup> = 512
* Binary is essentially saying a certain range in voltage represents a 0 and a certain range represents a 1

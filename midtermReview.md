# Midterm Review
## Binary Numbers
* In a base-two number system, the right-most bit represents ones, the second right-most bit represents twos, the third right-most bit represents fours, the fourth right-most bit represents eights, etc.
* For example, 64 is 1000000
### Two's Compliment
* Starting from the right, keep everything up to the LSB (the right-most 1). Flip the rest.

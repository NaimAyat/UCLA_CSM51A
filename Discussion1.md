# Discussion 1: April 4, 2018
## Overview
* TA office: T 2-3pm Eng IV 67-12
* Intro
* Binary representation
* Noise margin
* Boolean algebra
## Representation
* Binary 
  * Multiple bits to represent multiple states
  * If we have n buts, we can represent 2<sup>n</sup> states
  * Right-most bit = most significant bit (MSB)
  * Left-most bit = least significant bit (LSB)
  * V<sub>IH</sub> minumum input voltage represented as a 1
  * V<sub>IL</sub> maximum input voltage represented as a 0
  * V<sub>OH</sub> minimum output voltage represented as a 1
  * V<sub>OL</sub> maximum output voltage represented as a 0

## Discrete vs. Analog Representation
* Tradeoff: noiseless vs. data density
## [Practice Problems](practiceProblems/week1.pdf)
* 1.11. (i) Need 6 bits (ii) Need 4 bits to represent cards ace through king, plus 2 bits to represent the four different suits
